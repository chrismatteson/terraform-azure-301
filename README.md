# terraform-azure-301
A challenge style training on Terraform where individuals or groups compete to complete the objectives by fixing the code.

Each student group should have:
A username/password to access Azure Portal
A Terraform Enterprise enabled organization in TFC
Azure DevOps environment configured with code from the student folder
A TFC Workspace attached to the ADO code
The code successfully deployed using Terraform 0.11

At the start of the class, the instructor should delete the AKS clusters for everyone.

Students need to:
1) Get application running again
2) Upgrade code to 0.12
3) Modify code to pass sentinel tests
4) Improve/simplify code
5) Create dev/qa/prod environments as part of a pipeline

It's not expected that groups will finish all of these requirements in the time given.
